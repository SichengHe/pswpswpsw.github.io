I am a third year Ph.D. student in the [Aerospace Engineering](https://aero.engin.umich.edu/) and [Scientific Computing](https://micde.umich.edu/ph-d-in-scientific-computing/) at the [MICDE](https://micde.umich.edu/) at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am working with [Professor Karthik Duraisamy](https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/karthik-duraisamy/). Previously I was a M.S.E. student working with [Professor Eric Johnsen](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ejohnsen/) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Outside academia, I was an application engineer intern working with [Adrien Mann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrienmann/) and research engineer intern with [Dr. Ning Zhou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ning-zhou-58881b57/).
