Ph.D. candidate in Geoinformation Science with over five years of experience in search engine, recommendation system, machine learning, high performance computing, geospatial technologies, and object oriented software development. 

At GMU, I have worked as the technical lead for a couple of search engine, machine learning, and Web crawling projects funded by NASA and NSF. The MUDROD search engine for satellite imagery we developed is the first attempt of using machine learning to improve data discovery in the Earth science domain, which is being evaluated at NASA to be integrated into the operational system.
