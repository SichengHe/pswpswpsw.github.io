## OceanWorks / Apache Science Data Analytics Platform (SDAP) 
In typical investigations, oceanographers follow a traditional workflow for using datasets: search, evaluate, download, and apply tools and algorithms to look for trends. While this workflow has been working very well historically for the oceanographic community, it cannot scale if the research involves massive amount of data. SDAP establishes an integrated data analytic center for Big Science problems. It focuses on technology integration, advancement and maturity. SDAP brings together a number of big data technologies including a NASA funded OceanXtremes (Anomaly detection and ocean science), NEXUS (Deep data analytic platform), DOMS (Distributed in-situ to satellite matchup), MUDROD (Search relevancy and discovery) and VQSS (Virtualized Quality Screening Service) under a single umbrella.

## Mining and Utilizing Dataset Relevancy from Data Access logs, Metadata and User Metrics to Improve Data Discovery (MUDROD) (NASA AIST funded)
MUDROD is focused on mining oceanic knowledge from the [PO.DAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/) user log files to improve the end user data discovery experience at PO.DAAC. There are three steps in the research: a) the oceanographic semantics were extracted from three resources of SWEET, GCMD ontology, and the keywords used by end users for searching PO.DAAC datasets, b) mining the linkage among different vocabularies based on user data discvoery sessions, and c) build the linkage among vocabularies based on a comprehensive approach by considering domain de facto standard, e.g., SWEET and GCMD, and the knowledge mined from the log files. The semantics is used to improve data discovery for ranking results, navigating among vocabularies, and recommending data based on user searchers.

## A Knowledge Gateway for Smart Management and Discovery of Planetary Defense (PD) Information (NASA funded)
PD aims at developing a planetary defense knowledge discovery engine to better assist the development and integration of a near Earth object (NEO) responding system. This knowledge discovery engine will serve as a cyberinfrastructure building block for conglomerate patches of existing knowledge (e.g. data, service, and model). By integrating, extracting, analyzing, and providing knowledge dispersed throughout different organizations and scientists, this planetary defense web portal is expected to advance discovery, innovation and education across government agencies and scientific communities.
